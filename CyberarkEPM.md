CyberArk Endpoint Privilege Manager (EPM) is a security solution designed to protect endpoints by enforcing least privilege policies and preventing unauthorized access to sensitive resources. Let's explore how it is used in the real world with an example:

**Real-World Example:**

Consider a large financial institution that manages sensitive customer data and conducts numerous transactions daily. The institution has a distributed network of endpoints, including employee workstations, servers, and virtual machines. To ensure the security of its endpoints and protect against potential cyber threats, the institution decides to implement CyberArk Endpoint Privilege Manager (EPM).

1. **Privilege Management:**
   - With CyberArk EPM, the financial institution can enforce least privilege policies across all endpoints. For example, regular employees may only have access to certain applications and resources necessary for their job roles, while IT administrators have elevated privileges to perform system maintenance and troubleshooting tasks.
   
2. **Application Control:**
   - The financial institution can use CyberArk EPM to control the execution of applications on endpoints. For instance, only whitelisted applications approved by the IT security team are allowed to run, while unauthorized or potentially harmful applications are automatically blocked from execution.

3. **Credential Theft Protection:**
   - CyberArk EPM helps protect sensitive credentials stored on endpoints from being stolen by malicious actors or malware. It securely stores privileged account credentials in a vault, encrypts them, and restricts access based on role-based permissions. This prevents unauthorized users or malware from accessing critical systems and data.

4. **Privileged Session Recording:**
   - The financial institution can leverage CyberArk EPM's privileged session recording capabilities to monitor and audit user activities on endpoints. This includes recording privileged sessions initiated by IT administrators, capturing keystrokes, commands executed, and files accessed during the session. In the event of a security incident or compliance audit, the institution can review session recordings to identify any suspicious or unauthorized activities.

5. **Integration with CyberArk Core Privileged Access Security Solutions:**
   - CyberArk EPM seamlessly integrates with CyberArk's core Privileged Access Security Solution (PAS), providing centralized management and control of privileged access across the enterprise. This allows the financial institution to enforce consistent security policies and access controls across endpoints, servers, databases, and other critical IT infrastructure components.

By implementing CyberArk Endpoint Privilege Manager, the financial institution can enhance its endpoint security posture, reduce the risk of privilege abuse and credential theft, and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. It helps protect sensitive data, maintain operational continuity, and safeguard the organization's reputation from cyber threats and security breaches.
